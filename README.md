# FIFA18-Ultimate-Team-School-Project
This is a machine learning project with it's own report. Project is completed using R language. 

This project forecast football players market value using FIFA 18 Ultimate Team Dataset (for reference: https://www.kaggle.com/kevinmh/fifa-18-more-complete-player-dataset) The results are interpret according to their Mean Square Errors. 

Several analysis can be made using the plots created with R.

The aim of this project is to classify and predict football player value with different machine learning models. Random Forest Model, Multiple Regression, Lasso and Ridge Regression, and Regression Tree models are used to analyze FIFA 18 Ultimate Team Dataset. Results are interpreted with their RMSE. Our model with the lowest RMSE is Random Forest Model which means prediction accuracy is better than the others. 

Random Forest Models are models that easy to evaluate can give important insights into our dataset.
